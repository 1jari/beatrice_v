# Beatrice V  

**Beatrice V** is a robotics framework designed to be:  
âœ” **Functional** & **object-oriented**  
âœ” **Overengineered-by-nature** (because why not?)  
âœ” **Self-hosted** â€“ No dependency hell, just plug-and-play.  
âœ” Built for **low-spec machines** (ARM, AVR, and beyond), Beatrice V offers a modern, centralized alternative to frameworks like ROSâ€”powered by **Rust's efficiency** and a clean design philosophy.

## **ðŸš§ Status: Alpha**  
This is currently a **prototype**, but we're working hard on the first stable release with optimizations, correctness fixes, and more.

## **FAQ**  

### *Why another robotics framework?*  
Beatrice V was born out of frustration with bloated, dependency-heavy frameworks. We wanted something **self-hosted**, **efficient**, and tailored for **low-power devices**â€”without sacrificing modern tooling.  

### *What does the "V" stand for? Is this version 5?*  
Nope! The "V" is a nod to **Versis**, our company's suffix. (Though if we ever hit version 5, we'll take it as a win.)  

### *What makes Beatrice V innovative?*  
In simple terms: **It's ROS, but leaner and meaner.**  
In complex terms: An optimized, Rust-powered robotics environment for resource-constrained systems.  

### *Is Beatrice V production-ready?*  
**Not yet.** We've had less than 6 months of design, so expect rough edges. But we're actively fundraising to build a dedicated engineering teamâ€”**help us speed things up!**  

### *I ran Beatrice V and my robot exploded...*  
**Bugs happen.** Please [open an issue](https://github.com/Lunoversis/beatrice_v/issues) so we can fix it (and possibly send you a new robot).  

### *I used Beatrice V in production and now my company is bankrupt.*  
I give up.
